## How LaTeX Works in Mintlify âž—

Mintlify makes it incredibly simple to include mathematical notation in your documentation. You don't need to install any extra packages or configure complex plugins. It just works out of the box!

This allows you to seamlessly blend technical documentation with complex formulas, making your content richer and more precise.

### Inline Equations

You can easily embed formulas directly within your text by wrapping your LaTeX code in single dollar signs (`$`). This is perfect for mentioning variables or short expressions without breaking the flow of a sentence.

**For example:**

The famous mass-energy equivalence is expressed as $E=mc^2$. Similarly, to find the roots of a quadratic equation, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, one can use the quadratic formula.

### Block-Level Equations

For more complex or important equations that deserve their own space, you can use double dollar signs (`$$`). This will render the equation as a centered block.

**For example:**

The Fourier Transform is a beautiful mathematical tool, represented as:

$$
\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} dx
$$

Here is the formula for the standard deviation, a key concept in statistics:
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2}
$$
